        <h2>The cruel reality</h2>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, I haven't even read this book yet, so it wouldn't be
          polite If I <strong>choose</strong> to talk about something I don't
          really know, however; I've heard about this story in the past from the
          <span>animation TV series</span> they used to show
          <em>stories</em> and <em>analogies</em> of it.

          Some years ago-never mind how long precisely-having little or no money
          in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought
          I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world. It
          is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the
          circulation.

          At first sight, it is about the story of a whale that is incredibly
          dangerous, the main character I think it's Ishmael. There are several
          notes about the image itself:
          <ul>
            <li>
              The draw is incredible, how terrific would be in the same
              situation as they are...
            </li>
            <li>The whale is outstanding, look at it...</li>
            <li>
              I would need more sophisticated words to describe how amazed I am
              as result of a simple draw.
            </li>
          </ul>
